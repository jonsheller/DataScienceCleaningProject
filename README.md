DataScienceCleaningProject
==========================

## Summary

This is the repository for the course project in the Data Science Getting and Cleaning Data class on Coursera.

## Data Analysis

The script run_analysis.R opens the dataset, merges the test and training sets, selects only the desired columns, renames them, calculates the average by activity and subject, and saves the result into tidy_data.txt.

In order to run the script, you must unzip the dataset into the same directory as the script, not into a subfolder.

## Codebook

CodeBook.md contains descriptions of each column of the dataset, and the overall naming conventions.
