Codebook for Course Project
=============================

## Summary

Subject and Activity specify the subject and which activity they were performing.

Other variables are named in the following manner:

Each starts with time or frequency, to specify if the data were collected in the time or frequency domain.

Next, each contains "Body" or "Gravity" to specify whether the measurement occurred due to the force of gravity or the motion of the subject.

Next, each contains "Acceleration" for those variables measured by the accelerometer of the phone, or "Gyroscope" for those measured using the gyroscope.

If a variable is the derivative of the acceleration, it next contains "Jerk"

Next, each contains "Mean" or "StandardDeviation" to specify how the measurements were combined across the interval in which they occurred.

Next, each contains "X", "Y", or "Z" if it is for a particular axis, or "Magnitude" if it is the combined magnitude of the value.

Lastly, because these were averaged for subject and activity, each name ends in "Average".

## Variables
